                <p>
                    The history of time measurement goes back to the first civilizations (Egypt, China).
                    The measurement of time quickly became an important concern, in particular for organizing the
                    social,
                    religious and economic life of societies. The periodic phenomena of the environment in which Man
                    lived -
                    such as the daily movement of the shadow, the return of the seasons or the lunar cycle - served as
                    the
                    first references.<br><br>

                    But gradually, Man was inspired by physical phenomena, whose periodic nature he had noticed, to
                    design
                    and develop increasingly precise time measurement devices, as well as suitable units. The
                    application of
                    the pendulum to mechanical clocks is an example of this; these devices allowed men to know the time
                    at
                    any time and in any place.<br><br>

                    The calendar is not, strictly speaking, a measure of time. It is an account of the years and days in
                    a
                    year. The majority of calendars are defined in relation to the Sun or the Moon: a solar year has
                    approximately 365.242 19 days and a lunar month approximately 29.53 days.<br><br>

                    As the year defined by a calendar necessarily includes a whole number of months and days, we
                    understand
                    the difficulty that civilizations have faced to develop a year, and the months that compose it,
                    whose
                    duration approaches and, possibly, remains on average around the value of the chosen reference
                    period:
                    solar year, lunar month.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several calendars have succeeded or coexisted throughout history: Roman, Julian, Gregorian,
                    Orthodox,
                    Hebrew, Muslim, Coptic, Hindu, Egyptian, Hahai's, Zoroastrian, Inca, Chinese or Republican
                    calendars.<br><br>

                    <a class="liens" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar">See: calendars</a><br><br>
                    Each great civilization had its own calendar; it was a way to mark his time.<br>

                    The first traces of true calendars date back to Egypt and the Mayas and Aztecs, among whom the
                    priests
                    were also astronomers and possessed, with regard to the latter, a much more precise calendar than in
                    Europe at the same time.<br>

                    In -45, Julius Caesar asked the Greek astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria to reform the imprecise
                    Roman
                    calendar. He thus created the Julian calendar which innovated, creating leap years. The average
                    length
                    of a year, 365.25 days, brought it closer to the astronomical year, with a shift of three days every
                    400
                    years.<br><br>

                    It is the accumulation of this discrepancy that had the consequence that, around 1582, the Julian
                    calendar was already 10 days behind the astronomical year. The beginnings of the seasons occurred
                    earlier and earlier and the religious felt that they were no longer celebrating Easter on the right
                    date.<br><br>

                    Pope Gregory XIII addressed the astronomer Luigi Giglio who proposed that centenary years should
                    only be
                    leap years if they are divisible by 400; moreover he fixed the date of the vernal equinox at March
                    21st.
                    He thus gave birth to the Gregorian calendar that we use today. The average length of a Gregorian
                    calendar year is 365.2425 days, which even more closely approximates the true length of the
                    astronomical
                    year 365.2422…days. Its implementation also led to the deletion of 10 days to correct the gap
                    between
                    the dates of the seasons and their actual occurrence.

            <div class="cadrangnomon">
                <p>
                    From the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. AD, the Mesopotamians counted in base 60 using a
                    positional
                    numeration derived from the Sumerians' mixed base and additive type numeral system. This system is
                    generally associated with the Babylonian civilization, which occupied southern Mesopotamia after
                    -1800
                    and until the beginning of our era. This basis has survived the centuries: it is found today in the
                    notation of angles in degrees (360°= 6 x 60°) or in the division of time (1 hour = 60 minutes = 60²
                    seconds).<br><br>

                    Among the first to be concerned with the division of the day into units of time, we find the
                    Egyptians,
                    but first for religious purposes. The first period divided into "hours" was the night, about
                    forty-one
                    centuries ago.
                    To identify the flow of time, the sky had been divided into 36 decans associated with deities, each
                    decan consisted of one or more stars. The nocturnal observers watched the procession of the decans;
                    and
                    according to the time of year the number of decans visible from dusk to dawn varied. At the summer
                    solstice, when the nights are the shortest and when the heliacal rising of Sirius approaches, only
                    twelve decans were observable with certainty, the others were lost in the gleams of sunrise or
                    sunset.
                    Around 2100 BC. AD it was decided to keep only the observation of twelve decans during the night: it
                    was
                    thus divided into twelve parts which were maintained throughout the year. Thus the first period,
                    other
                    than the year, precisely marked out was the night and not the day. But that only concerned the
                    pharaoh,
                    and his relationship with the gods. Tables have been found in sarcophagi giving the decans dividing
                    the
                    night into twelve parts.<br><br>
                    Six centuries later the texts indicate a division of the day also into twelve hours, undoubtedly by
                    symmetry with the night.</p><br>

                title="Sundial in the walled garden at Brodick castle">

            <div class="intro1">
                <p>Associated with this division is the first real known sundial: it is an “L” shaped piece. It is
                    oriented
                    in an east-west direction, the shadow cast by the vertical upright on the other part indicates the
                    hours
                    on either side of noon.<br><br>

                    Graduations are fixed and do not take into account the influence of the season: a day is divided
                    into
                    twelve hours
                    regardless of its length.<br><br>

                    The times indicated therefore do not have the same length throughout the year, longer in summer than
                    in
                    winter. In Egypt the difference is quite small (40%) not to be too noticeable (unlike Western Europe
                    where, between winter and summer, the length of the day varies from one to two). <br><br>

                    This division into twice twelve hours is kept and adopted by the Chaldeans around the 7th century
                    BC.
                    J.-C. then spreads in Greece and is perpetuated thereafter, until our days. Our 24 hours are
                    Egyptian.<br><br>

                    The Babylonian numeral system was sexagesimal, the division of hours and minutes took over this
                    system.
                    Thus, the hour is divided into 60 minutes and the minute into 60 seconds. Sixty is a number that has
                    the
                    particularity of having a large number of integer divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30 and
                    60), which facilitates astronomical calculations.<br><br>

                    The Romans used portable sundials, such as the shepherd's sundial.<br><br>

            <h2>Use of mechanical periodic phenomena</h2>
            <p>
                But Man was not content to observe and use nature. He also knew how to use his sense of observation and
                his intelligence to design time-measuring instruments that are not necessarily based on natural
                phenomena that are not under his control. The practices of daily life (speaking time in a council, a
                trial, ringing of bells for office hours, town council meetings, curfew, etc.) provided him with the
                motivation.

                The Egyptians used the clepsydra, a large vase pierced at its base, graduated inside and which lets out
                a thin trickle of water. The Greeks perfected it to make it more precise. They added a dial and a needle
                to it, transforming it into a real measuring instrument.<br><br>

                Of unknown origin, the hourglass is based on the same principle as the clepsydra, except that the water
                is replaced by sand. It is used more to measure intervals of time than to indicate the time. A commonly
                quoted anecdote is that of Christopher Columbus who, in 1492, during his voyage to America, used an
                hourglass to take stock, which he turned over since his departure every half hour.<br>

                These tools were imprecise over long periods and discrepancies accumulated.<br>

                        <h4>The mechanical clock</h4>
                    </td>
                    <td class="contentable">The first mechanical clocks appeared in the 14th century. At the beginning,
                        they rang the bells,
                        did not
                        have a dial and,
                        when they were equipped with one in the 15th century, there would be only one hand, that of the
                        hours.

                        These first clocks consist schematically of a driving weight which drives a train of gears,
                        which
                        incidentally turns the
                        hand or hands. The whole only constitutes a clock if one knows how to regulate the fall of the
                        weight.
                        It is the
                        appearance of the escapement that will transform this simple assembly of gears into a real
                        clock. The
                        escapement allows
                        alternately to release then to block the fall of the weight, thanks to an oscillating mechanism.

                        In these first clocks, this mechanism is a foliot, a simple rod at the ends of which are hung
                        two
                        masses, which can
                        oscillate horizontally around a vertical axis supporting it in the middle. The masses give it
                        the
                        necessary inertia to
                        stop the fall of the weight. Attached to the axis of oscillation, two pallets alternately block
                        the
                        counter wheel (which
                        gives its name to this first type of escapement) driven by the weight of the engine3.

                        This very ingenious mechanism is also very difficult to adjust precisely; friction and shocks
                        are
                        important, difficult
                        to control. And above all, each of the elements participates indistinguishably in both motor and
                        regulatory functions.</td>

                    <td class="contentable">Among many other phenomena, Galileo studied the swinging pendulum and noted
                        that the period (the
                        duration of a full
                        round trip) of the pendulum seemed to be remarkably constant for a given pendulum. In 1641 he
                        designed a
                        project for a
                        clock regulated by an oscillating pendulum without building it. It was ultimately Christiaan
                        Huygens and
                        Salomon Coster
                        who built the first pendulum clock in 1657.

                        Technical progress is important; conceptual progress is even more so. The regulating and motor
                        functions
                        are clearly
                        identified and separated, which will make precise adjustments possible. The first clocks delayed
                        the
                        fall of a weight
                        thanks to an irregular oscillating mechanism through an escapement. Pendulum clocks maintain the
                        regular
                        oscillating
                        movement of the pendulum by drawing through the escapement just the energy necessary for a
                        weight that
                        descends.

                        In 1675, Huygens also invented the spiral spring, regulating organs, which along with the
                        balance wheel
                        would constitute
                        the regulating organ for watches.</td>

                        Christopher
                        Columbus. In
                        particular, the
                        determination of the longitude makes it necessary to keep the time of the port of departure on
                        board. So
                        much so that at
                        the beginning of the 18th century the British and Spanish governments offered strong rewards to
                        the
                        scientist who
                        succeeded in building a transportable chronometer with sufficient precision and, above all,
                        sufficient
                        stability to make
                        a complete point at sea. Because it is impossible to operate a pendulum on a boat because of the
                        roll.

                        Such a measuring instrument was invented by British watchmaker John Harrison in 1737. After
                        several
                        attempts, he created
                        a stopwatch with amazing accuracy and stability. He won the prize in 1764 only with his fourth
                        prototype, much more
                        compact in its form, and which, in two months of travel, shifted only a few seconds, a
                        performance never

            <h2>Modern methods</h2>
            <p>From now on, mechanical clocks are no longer the order of the day in terms of precision. More
                precise and more compact means have been developed. In this respect, the quartz clock
                constituted real progress.<br>

                Quartz is a form of silicon dioxide (SiO2) <img src="silicon-dioxide.jpg" title="SiO2" width="50"
                    height="50"> is abundant in nature. Like all rigid materials,
                a piece of quartz <img src="32-768Hz.jpg" width="50" height="50"> resonates at frequencies specific to
                it (for example 32,768 Hz for the quartz
                in common watches). In addition, its hardness allows it
                to have high vibration frequencies,
                which is very favorable for precision.
                However, when a quartz crystal vibrates, weak electrical charges appear and disappear on its
                surface. This is the <a href="Piezoelectric.jpg">piezoelectric effect</a>
                </a>.
                <!-- Mettre l'ímage visible quand on survol le mot --> These charges are detected
                and serve to
                control and
                stabilize the operation of an electronic oscillator. The precision obtained is ten times greater
                than the best of mechanical clockwork mechanisms. The first quartz oscillator to operate on this
                principle appeared in 1933, but its size was closer to a refrigerator than a wristwatch. Product
                of a great miniaturization, the latter only appeared in the 1970s.<br><br>

                But to meet the growing need for precision in science and cutting-edge techniques, quartz alone
                is still too imprecise. The next step is the atomic clock. In this, the stability of an
                electronic oscillator is no longer based on the oscillations of a single crystal, but on those
                of the electromagnetic wave (of the same nature as light) emitted by an electron during its
                transition from one energy level to another inside the atom. The first
                atomic clock appeared in 1947; it used the atomic transitions of the ammonia molecule. Then we
                had recourse to rubidium and, above all, to cesium. It is this last body which currently ensures
                the most exact and stable operation for an atomic clock. The first cesium clock appeared in
                1955. Since then, it has continued to improve. The current performance
                of clocks corresponds to a lag of one second every 3 million years. Cold atom cesium fountains
                are ten times more efficient. Atomic transitions of other simple bodies like ytterbium, at
                optical frequencies much higher than the frequency used in cesium clocks, are
                being studied around the world and will further gain a factor of ten to one hundred.<br>

                The next step will be the miniaturization of atomic oscillators which will then become
                components that can be inserted into a watch or a GPS or Galileo receiver. The American
                organization of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is currently working
                (2007) in this direction4, as well as the European consortium MAC-TFC: MEMS
                Atomic Clocks for Timing, Frequency control and Communications, (www.mac-tfc- had).
